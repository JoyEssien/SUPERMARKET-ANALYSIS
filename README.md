# SUPERMARKET ANALYSIS

## PROJECT SUMMARY
---

This project involves a comprehensive analysis of a supermarket's sales performance over one year, focusing on six product lines across three cities and three branches. The goal is to provide actionable insights into revenue distribution, customer loyalty, and strategic investment.

### Key Objectives:
 - Annual Revenue Overview: Analyze the total revenue generated over the past year, broken down by product line, region, and branch.
 - Regional and Branch Revenue Analysis: Determine which cities and branches are the top performers in terms of sales and revenue, identifying opportunities for expansion or improvement.
 - Loyalty Program Insights: Assess the impact of the membership card program on revenue, helping to identify which customer segments are the most loyal and which regions have the highest engagement.
 - Discounted Sales Planning: Plan a special discounted sales event as a reward for loyal customers. The analysis will identify which customer groups to target and how to structure the discounts for maximum 
   effectiveness.
 - Product Line Evaluation: Evaluate each product line to determine which ones have the highest revenue potential, guiding decisions on where to invest more resources. Additionally, identify underperforming product 
   lines that may need to be discontinued or restructured.
